        So, Hello guys I am a 19 year girl, with a 4 year old son. I first had my son at the age of 14 years old. I was a freshman who was attending Lane Tech College Prep. In that enviornment I felt like everyone was discriminative against me and I was giving the same chance as other students, with that I left that school. I later transfered schools and realized this school was considerate in how I felt, in what I needed, and how I thought. They thought about me as a person not an animal. In being in this school I was able to succeed and past all those teen mother stereotypes. I am now attending this program by the name of Year Up. This program helps me understand the fundamentals of hardware, software, and web developement.</p>
